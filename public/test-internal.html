<p>This is an ugly internal page</p>

<p>This page does not interact properly with the MicroApp SDK as you can see the size did not change.</p>

<p>The purpose of this test is to show how a MicroApp could change it's own URL without bouncing out of the app.</p>

<button onclick="goBack()">Go Back</button>

<script>
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back()
    }
</script>

</body>
